# material_recognition_through_glcm_texture

## Theory behind
These statistics can characterize the texture of an image as they provide information about the local variability of pixels intensity values in an image.
For example:
- in areas with smooth texture, the range of values in the neighborhood around a pixel is a small;
- in areas of rough texture, the range is larger.

Grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is a statistical method for deriving texture features
considering the relationship between groups of two pixels in the image at certain distance and at certain angle.

### GLCM Correlation
estimate deformities in the textural image.
### GLCM Dissimilarity
estimate heterogeneity in the image texture.

## Use example

Current project can be used in various study fields, from medical to geological.

Project initially was created to recognize different soil material using its texture feature out of the recorder video file.

This is the efficient way to speed up the data exploration as within the minutes of analysis
it provides  clear recognition of the material, estimation of its structure and distinct thresholds where material type is changing.
